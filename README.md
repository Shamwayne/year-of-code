# Year of Code Challenge

### *Also known as the 2 months sprint challenge*

The premise of the Year of Code challenge is simple

Every 2 months from January to December I implement an idea in my head that i want to do from writing the project specification up until a working MVP. The demo project and all the details related to it are then uploaded onto GitHub or any shared repository as a proof of concept of the idea and also as a learning tool. the most dissertation like project is then choses from the above and further refined for dissertation.



### Rules

- Every Project from start to end must take no more than 2 months to complete from start to end including documentation
- For the purposes of this challenge, the 2 months period refers to the the last day of the 2nd month in which the project was initiated. Since the starting date was the **1st of January 2018**, that means every **1st day of the  3rd month** is when the next project officially commences.
- As a clarification to the above point, the **1st day of March, May, July, September,November and the 31st of December** are when the next project is scheduled to commence except for the 31st of December which is the last day of the challenge
- The number of days in a month don't matter for the purposes of this challenge
- Deliverables required for a project to be considered completed are a Project Outline, Source Code, **Working Demo Prototype*** uploaded on GitHub and Documentation/Whitepaper reference for the project. Post Mortem documents whilst wanted are not necessary for the project to be considered completed
- A Working demo prototype is a prototype in which at least 60% of the specs of the outline are met with relatively few bugs barring special circumstances in which the challenges to the prototypes functionality have to be outlined clearly
- If the project is complete ahead of schedule, the project must be continually improved and polished until after at least the 6 week mark then I am free to do another project (helps me focus on the task at hand and apply polish where it's needed)



### Projects under implementation consideration

* Vehicle Recognition web app using number-plates Identification
* Project Hailey: A more advanced chatbot framework for use in psychiatry
* A custom made electronic mail app with e2e encryption and distributed messaging?
* Showcase: An online multimedia store with anti piracy features and offline capabilities
* Content based image/video search engine
* Whatever: an online group messaging platform/forum
* An interactive Virtual Reality app/game with at least a complete room to look around and not some empty space



Yup, this challenge is going to be a little challenging, but that's the point. This is also a platform to learn and experiment with the latest web development technologies and also with practical applications of at least basic Artificial Intelligence principles as well as good software design thinking.

The reason i chose this over the 100 days of code challenge was because :

1. I have way to many ideas i want to try out and this gives me a platform and incentive to do so
2. The best way to learn practical skills is by making practical (albeit slightly ambitious) projects
3. Working demos are far more impressive for a portfolio than projects just sitting around, plus my GitHub was feeling pretty empty at the moment
4. I can simultaneously take care of school requirements too for things like dissertation
5. I can always market and sell any one of these projects for profit as well since they're all mostly marketable projects anyway
